```

## 💡 **Immediate Cost Savings Identified**

Based on your current infrastructure:

### **Quick Wins ($1-2/month savings)**
1. **Route 53 Review**: Do you need all 3 domains?
   - `quizamie.com`, `idpetech.com`, `techgressions.com`
   - Each costs $0.50/month

2. **S3 Cleanup**: 
   - Several empty buckets can be deleted
   - Large deployment bucket (730MB) could use lifecycle policies

### **Trend Analysis (Great News!)**
- ✅ **Costs decreasing**: 25% reduction week-over-week
- ✅ **Daily average**: Only $0.31/day ($9.33/month)
- ✅ **Under budget**: Very reasonable for your infrastructure

## 🔧 **Adding Missing Permissions (Optional)**
