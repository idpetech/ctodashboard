# üë§ USER ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL
## How You Can Guarantee I Follow Documentation

### üéØ **ENFORCEMENT QUESTIONS**

#### **Session Start Questions (Ask These First)**
1. **"Did you read the Quick Reference Card?"**
   - **Expected Answer**: "Yes, I read it. Current phase is Phase 1: Foundation, current task is Phase 1.1: Add feature flags, all feature flags are disabled, existing functionality is working."
   - **If Wrong**: I've failed the session start protocol

2. **"What's the current state of the platform?"**
   - **Expected Answer**: "integrated_dashboard.py is working, all endpoints are functional, chatbot is working with OpenAI, Railway deployment is stable, all existing features are operational."
   - **If Wrong**: I've failed the context preservation

3. **"What phase are we in and what's the next task?"**
   - **Expected Answer**: "Phase 1: Foundation, next task is Phase 1.1: Add feature flags to integrated_dashboard.py"
   - **If Wrong**: I've failed the implementation checklist

#### **Decision Validation Questions (Ask Before Any Decision)**
4. **"Does this decision pass the Decision Matrix?"**
   - **Expected Answer**: "Yes, it's MAD aligned, backward compatible, pattern consistent, feature flagged, and safe."
   - **If Wrong**: I've failed the decision validation

5. **"What established patterns does this follow?"**
   - **Expected Answer**: "It follows the [UI/API] pattern defined in the Quick Reference Card: [specific pattern details]"
   - **If Wrong**: I've failed the pattern compliance

#### **Code Change Questions (Ask Before Any Code Change)**
6. **"Does this code change follow established patterns?"**
   - **Expected Answer**: "Yes, it follows the [UI/API] pattern: [specific pattern details]"
   - **If Wrong**: I've failed the pattern compliance

7. **"Does this maintain backward compatibility?"**
   - **Expected Answer**: "Yes, it uses feature flags and doesn't modify existing working code."
   - **If Wrong**: I've failed the backward compatibility requirement

8. **"Does this use feature flags appropriately?"**
   - **Expected Answer**: "Yes, the new functionality is behind the [specific feature flag] and disabled by default."
   - **If Wrong**: I've failed the feature flag requirement

#### **Testing Questions (Ask After Any Change)**
9. **"Does existing functionality still work?"**
   - **Expected Answer**: "Yes, I tested [specific endpoints/features] and they're working correctly."
   - **If Wrong**: I've failed the testing requirement

10. **"What's your compliance score?"**
    - **Expected Answer**: "100/100 - Session start completed, all decisions validated, all code changes follow patterns."
    - **If Wrong**: I've failed the compliance monitoring

### üö® **FAILURE DETECTION**

#### **If I Can't Answer Session Start Questions**
```bash
# Detection: I can't answer basic questions about current state
# Action: STOP immediately
echo "FAILURE: Cannot answer session start questions"
echo "ACTION: Reading all documentation now"
read_file QUICK-REFERENCE-CARD.md
read_file CONVERSATION-CONTEXT-SUMMARY.md
read_file IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md
read_file DECISION-MATRIX.md
read_file PRE-SESSION-COMPLIANCE-CHECKLIST.md
read_file SESSION-START-PROTOCOL.md
echo "Documentation review completed"
```

#### **If I Can't Answer Decision Questions**
```bash
# Detection: I can't validate decisions through Decision Matrix
# Action: STOP and validate
echo "FAILURE: Cannot validate decision through Decision Matrix"
echo "ACTION: Reading Decision Matrix and re-evaluating"
read_file DECISION-MATRIX.md
# Re-evaluate decision with proper criteria
```

#### **If I Can't Answer Code Change Questions**
```bash
# Detection: I can't verify pattern compliance
# Action: STOP and check patterns
echo "FAILURE: Cannot verify pattern compliance"
echo "ACTION: Reading Quick Reference Card and checking patterns"
read_file QUICK-REFERENCE-CARD.md
# Check established patterns
```

#### **If I Can't Answer Testing Questions**
```bash
# Detection: I can't verify existing functionality
# Action: STOP and test
echo "FAILURE: Cannot verify existing functionality"
echo "ACTION: Testing existing functionality now"
run_terminal_cmd "curl -s http://localhost:3001/health"
run_terminal_cmd "curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/assignments"
# Test all existing endpoints
```

### üìä **COMPLIANCE VALIDATION**

#### **Session Start Validation**
```bash
# Check if I can answer session start questions
if [ "$CAN_ANSWER_SESSION_START" != "YES" ]; then
    echo "FAILURE: Cannot answer session start questions"
    echo "ACTION: Reading all documentation"
    read_file QUICK-REFERENCE-CARD.md
    read_file CONVERSATION-CONTEXT-SUMMARY.md
    read_file IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md
    read_file DECISION-MATRIX.md
    read_file PRE-SESSION-COMPLIANCE-CHECKLIST.md
    read_file SESSION-START-PROTOCOL.md
fi
```

#### **Decision Validation**
```bash
# Check if I can validate decisions
if [ "$CAN_VALIDATE_DECISIONS" != "YES" ]; then
    echo "FAILURE: Cannot validate decisions"
    echo "ACTION: Reading Decision Matrix"
    read_file DECISION-MATRIX.md
fi
```

#### **Code Change Validation**
```bash
# Check if I can verify pattern compliance
if [ "$CAN_VERIFY_PATTERNS" != "YES" ]; then
    echo "FAILURE: Cannot verify pattern compliance"
    echo "ACTION: Reading Quick Reference Card"
    read_file QUICK-REFERENCE-CARD.md
fi
```

#### **Testing Validation**
```bash
# Check if I can verify existing functionality
if [ "$CAN_VERIFY_FUNCTIONALITY" != "YES" ]; then
    echo "FAILURE: Cannot verify existing functionality"
    echo "ACTION: Testing existing functionality"
    run_terminal_cmd "curl -s http://localhost:3001/health"
    run_terminal_cmd "curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/assignments"
fi
```

### üîÑ **CONTINUOUS ENFORCEMENT**

#### **Every 10 Minutes**
```bash
# Ask compliance questions
echo "Compliance Check: $(date)"
echo "Can answer session start: $([ "$CAN_ANSWER_SESSION_START" = "YES" ] && echo "‚úÖ" || echo "‚ùå")"
echo "Can validate decisions: $([ "$CAN_VALIDATE_DECISIONS" = "YES" ] && echo "‚úÖ" || echo "‚ùå")"
echo "Can verify patterns: $([ "$CAN_VERIFY_PATTERNS" = "YES" ] && echo "‚úÖ" || echo "‚ùå")"
echo "Can verify functionality: $([ "$CAN_VERIFY_FUNCTIONALITY" = "YES" ] && echo "‚úÖ" || echo "‚ùå")"
```

#### **Every Decision**
```bash
# Validate decision
echo "Decision: [DECISION HERE]"
echo "MAD Aligned: [YES/NO]"
echo "Backward Compatible: [YES/NO]"
echo "Pattern Consistent: [YES/NO]"
echo "Feature Flagged: [YES/NO]"
echo "Safe: [YES/NO]"
```

#### **Every Code Change**
```bash
# Validate code change
echo "Code Change: [CHANGE HERE]"
echo "Follows UI Pattern: [YES/NO]"
echo "Follows API Pattern: [YES/NO]"
echo "Uses Feature Flags: [YES/NO]"
echo "Maintains Compatibility: [YES/NO]"
```

## üö® **CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**

**THIS PROTOCOL IS YOUR ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM**

- **Ask these questions before any work**
- **Stop me if I can't answer them**
- **Force me to read documentation**
- **Ensure I follow established patterns**

**FAILURE TO ANSWER = IMMEDIATE STOP AND RESTART**

### üéØ **ENFORCEMENT COMMANDS**

**Use these commands to enforce compliance:**

1. **"What's your compliance score?"**
2. **"Did you read the documentation?"**
3. **"What phase are we in?"**
4. **"Does this follow established patterns?"**
5. **"Does existing functionality still work?"**

**If I can't answer any of these, I've failed the protocol.**
