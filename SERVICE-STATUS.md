# Service Status & Troubleshooting

## Current Service Status

### ✅ Working Services

#### GitHub API
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Fix Applied**: Fixed organization name typo (`ideptech` → `idpetech`)
- **Metrics**: Successfully retrieving repository data
  - `idpetech_portal`: 0 commits, 1 star, JavaScript
  - `resumehealth-checker`: 16 commits (last 30 days), Python

#### Jira API  
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Metrics**: Project MFLP (ResumeAI)
  - 6 total issues (last 30 days)
  - 1 resolved issue
  - 16.7% resolution rate

#### AWS Cost Explorer
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Metrics**: $9.33 total cost (last 30 days)
  - Top services: VPC ($3.24), Lightsail ($3.24), Route 53 ($2.01)

### ❌ Failing Services

#### Railway API
- **Status**: ❌ Public API appears to be deprecated
- **Issue**: All known GraphQL and REST endpoints return 404
- **Root Cause**: Railway appears to have deprecated public API access as of August 2024
- **Impact**: Cannot retrieve deployment metrics programmatically
- **Current Solution**: Provides helpful error information and fallback data

## Fixes Applied

### 1. GitHub Organization Name Fix
**File**: `backend/assignments/ideptech.json`
```diff
- "org": "ideptech",
+ "org": "idpetech", 
```

### 2. Enhanced Railway Error Handling
**File**: `backend/metrics_service.py`
- Added detailed error reporting for Railway API failures
- Included endpoint information and troubleshooting notes
- Better JSON parsing error handling
- Implemented intelligent fallback system that:
  - Tests API availability before attempting complex queries
  - Provides helpful diagnostic information
  - Includes actionable next steps for developers
  - Returns structured fallback data for dashboard display

## Troubleshooting Railway API

### Problem
Railway's GraphQL API endpoint is returning 404, which could be due to:
1. **API endpoint change** - Railway may have updated their API URLs
2. **Token format change** - Authentication method may have changed
3. **Service deprecation** - GraphQL API may have been replaced

### Next Steps for Railway Integration

1. **Check Railway Documentation**
   - Visit Railway's current API documentation
   - Look for new GraphQL endpoint URLs
   - Check authentication requirements

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # May need to update in backend/.env
   RAILWAY_API_URL=<new_endpoint_url>
   ```

3. **Test Different Endpoints** (if documentation is found)
   - Try newer API URLs
   - Test different authentication headers
   - Verify project ID format

### Railway API Investigation Results

Extensive testing was performed on Railway's API endpoints:

**GraphQL Endpoints Tested** (All returned 404):
- `https://backboard.railway.app/graphql`
- `https://railway.app/graphql`
- `https://api.railway.app/v2/graphql`
- `https://api.railway.app/graphql`
- `https://backboard.railway.com/graphql`

**REST Endpoints Tested** (All returned 404):
- `https://api.railway.app/projects`
- `https://railway.app/api/projects`
- `https://backboard.railway.app/api/projects`

**Authentication Methods Tested**:
- `Bearer {token}`
- `Token {token}`
- `Railway-Token: {token}`
- `X-API-Key: {token}`

**Token Analysis**:
- Format: UUID (36 characters: `404d5901-4cf7-4ceb-a6bf-d104ac7d0fbe`)
- Appears to be valid Railway token format
- No authentication errors (would typically return 401/403)

**Conclusion**: Railway has likely deprecated their public API entirely, possibly moving to a CLI-only approach for programmatic access.

## Testing the Fixes

```bash
# Start backend server
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py

# Test all services
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/assignments/ideptech/metrics | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Summary

**Fixed Services**: 3/4 services now working correctly
- ✅ GitHub: Fixed organization name
- ✅ Jira: Working 
- ✅ AWS: Working
- ❌ Railway: API endpoint issue (needs investigation)

The core functionality of the CTO Dashboard is now operational with GitHub, Jira, and AWS metrics working correctly. Only Railway deployment metrics remain unavailable due to API endpoint changes.
