# ðŸš€ CTO DASHBOARD - SIMPLE COMMANDS

## ðŸŽ¯ **TWO COMMANDS TO REMEMBER**

### **1. `make help`** - Show All Commands
```bash
make help
```
**This shows you EVERYTHING** - all available commands, current state, and what to do next.

### **2. `make track`** - Get AI Back On Track
```bash
make track
```
**This gets the AI back on track immediately** - reads all documentation, shows current state, and sets next steps.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **THAT'S IT!**

**Just remember these two commands:**

- **`make help`** - Shows everything
- **`make track`** - Gets AI back on track

**Everything else is in the help!**

---

## ðŸš€ **Quick Examples**

```bash
# See all commands
make help

# Get AI back on track
make track

# Start dashboard
make start

# Check status
make status

# Enforce compliance
make enforce
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips**

1. **Always start with `make help`** to see what's available
2. **Use `make track`** if the AI seems lost or off-track
3. **Use `make status`** to see current state
4. **Use `make enforce`** to start with full compliance

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current State**

- **Phase**: Phase 1: Foundation
- **Task**: Phase 1.1: Add feature flags
- **Status**: Ready to begin work
- **Platform**: Working and stable

---

## ðŸ”’ **Enforcement**

The AI is **structurally enforced** to:
- âœ… Read documentation before any work
- âœ… Follow established patterns
- âœ… Use feature flags for new functionality
- âœ… Maintain backward compatibility
- âœ… Test thoroughly before deployment

**No exceptions. No shortcuts. No tangents.**
