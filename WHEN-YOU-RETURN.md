# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Back from Workshop!

## ðŸŽ¯ First Things First

### 1. Check Railway Deployment (2 min)
```bash
make railway-status
```

Expected: `"status": "read_only"` âœ…

### 2. Test the Dashboard (5 min)
Visit: https://web-production-07894.up.railway.app/

Test:
- âœ… Dashboard loads
- âœ… Metrics display
- âœ… AI chatbot responds
- âœ… Streaming works

### 3. Read the Plan (10 min)
```bash
cat PLAN-FOR-REVIEW.md
```

This has all proposed next steps for discussion.

## ðŸ“‹ What We Need to Decide

1. **Chatbot**: Cache metrics or fetch fresh?
2. **Service Config**: GitHub only first or all at once?
3. **Priority**: Service config or workstream management first?

## ðŸš€ Current Status

âœ… **v2.0.0 deployed to Railway**
âœ… **AI chatbot with streaming + real metrics**
âœ… **Clean architecture (78% reduction)**
âœ… **Validation system (zero failures)**

## ðŸ’¬ Let's Discuss

When ready, just say:
- "Let's review the plan" 
- "I'm back, what's next?"
- Or ask any questions!

**No rush - review at your pace.** ðŸ˜Š
